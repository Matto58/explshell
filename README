expl
----
an experimental shell written in python. tested with python 3.11-3.13. the
name is an inside joke, refers to the exploding head emoji on discord being
typeable by typing :expl and pressing tab

command list: [required] (optional)
- about (switches...)
  - shows info about the shell
  - switches:
    - --primitive | -p: shows only the version and name
- cd (path...)
  - changes directory or displays the current one if no path is specified
- clear
  - clears the console
- echo [text...]
  - prints whatever was inputted
- err [error code] (text...)
  - sets the error code of the command and prints the specified error
- exit
  - exits expl
- ls (path...)
  - lists the contents of the specified directory or the current one

useful information:
- configuration is located at ~/.expl/config.yaml
- if anything goes wrong, keep in mind this shell is wip
  - when reporting your issue, be descriptive, yet respectful
    - good example: "hi matto this x feature broke and this is the output"
    - bad example: "you dogshit dev this shit broke and i will not show output"
- please don't make prs the size of the whole andromeda galaxy! adding features
  should not really require a whole rewrite of the code base!
  - (unless they do, in which case, well, good luck with getting your feature
    added)
